This repository is for exercises in Part 6 of Full Stack Open (FSO), "Advanced state management" - https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2

The exercises in this part focus on front-end development in React. Some of them also have a back-end component, which is handled through json-server.

The projects in this section focus on react state management either through Redux or through the combination of React Query for backend and useReducer for frontend.

There are three projects contained in this repository, each in their own subfolder:

* /unicafe-redux - a web app that counts 'good' 'ok' and 'bad' reviews of a university cafe; uses Redux for state management
* /redux-anecdotes - a web app that displays a list of software development anecdotes; uses Redux for state management
* /query-anecdotes - a web app that displays a list of software development anecdotes; uses React Query and useReducer for state management
