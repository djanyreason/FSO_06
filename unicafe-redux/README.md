This folder contains the course information project which is developed in exercises 6.1-6.2 of Full Stack Open part 2: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6/flux_architecture_and_redux#exercises-6-1-6-2

The app is built starting from code in the following repository: https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/unicafe-redux

This web app has four buttons - three record reviews of 'good', 'ok', and 'bad'; the fourth resets the counters. The app displays the total number of each review.

This project is built using React. Its primary focus is using Redux to manage state.
